Welcome to the "insert company" data science community site. We're glad you're here! This site will include recordings of past events, resources, and information for getting set-up with the tools available in the organization.

All are welcome - no matter your team or experience. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out on our Data Science Slack channel.
